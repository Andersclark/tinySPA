# TinySPA

This is my playground as I figure out how rendering and reactivity works.

## Current status

* [x] Recursive rendering of data-structure
* [ ] Basic reactivity: Re-render entire DOM-tree when data changes
* [ ] Advanced reactivity: Selectively re-render parts of DOM based on data changes


## Want to play?

1. Clone the repo and start messing with the data structure inside the `spa.ts` file.
